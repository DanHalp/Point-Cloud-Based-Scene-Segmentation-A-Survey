# Point-Cloud-Based-Scene-Segmentation-A-Survey

> Autonomous driving is a safety-critical application, and it is therefore a top priority that the accompanying assistance
systems are able to provide precise information about the surrounding environment of the vehicle. Tasks such as 3D Object Detection
deliver an insufficiently detailed understanding of the surrounding scene because they only predict a bounding box for foreground
objects. In contrast, 3D Semantic Segmentation provides richer and denser information about the environment by assigning a label to
each individual point, which is of paramount importance for autonomous driving tasks, such as navigation or lane changes. To inspire
future research, in this review paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art methods in the field of Point
Cloud Semantic Segmentation for autonomous driving. We categorize the approaches into projection-based, 3D-based and hybrid
methods. Moreover, we discuss the most important and commonly used datasets for this task and also emphasize the importance of
synthetic data to support research when real-world data is limited. We further present the results of the different methods and compare
them with respect to their segmentation accuracy and efficiency.
